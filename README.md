# UnrealEngineRUI

repo for my work in progress reuable ui kit, meant to be a simplistic, blueprint only, color themeable solution for my unreal applications on 4.11+ engine versions
there are some wip plugins in the repo as well, that I am developing alongside, as I am still working out what is needed and ways to set things up
